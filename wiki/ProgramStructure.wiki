= Introduction =

This page is to give developers an idea about how the program logic flows and what choices were made in the design of this program.

= Requirements =
== Functional ==

The program is designed to follow the spirit of the Template Attribute Language (TAL) in the use of related concepts and attributes.

== Non-functional ==

As the program is to be used in a web application environment, speed is important.

Speed is important because the program is executed in a browser which is known to be slow. And since the program is designed to manipulate the user interface, a fast and responsive interface is an important requirement.

= Program Flow =
== Initialize ==
All variables are initialized on every execution. There are no global variables except for configuration code such as the `datatype formatter`, `intercept callbacks` and `attribute customizer`.

Copies of global variables are stored as local variables during execution to improve performance.
