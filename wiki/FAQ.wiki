#summary Frequently Asked Questions

===What's with the name?===
Distal is an acronym for Dynamic Interface Simplified with Template Attribute Language. Distal also represents the "distance" between the data and the user interface as being a valley that is difficult to cross. Distal also happens to be phonetically similar to "distill" which patrons the notion of distilling data into the HTML tree.

===What's with the logo?===
The logo is a database with whipped cream on top. A notion that Distal puts the user interface (whipped cream) right next to the data (database). This is not to be taken literally. Always follow the rules of Model-View-Controller and abstraction.
