===What's with the name?===
Distal is an acronym for Dynamic Interface Simplified with Template Attribute Language. Distal also represents the "distance" between the data and the user interface as being a valley that is difficult to cross. Distal also happens to be phonetically similar to "distill" which patrons the notion of distilling data into the HTML tree.

===What's with the logo?===
The logo is a database with whipped cream on top. A notion that Distal puts the user interface (whipped cream) right next to the data (database). This is not to be taken literally. Always follow the rules of Model-View-Controller and abstraction.

===Will my page validate against the W3C validator?===
Yes, provided that you use the latest HTML doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This doctype allows the use of arbitrary "data-" attributes in your HTML. Another advantage is that because your HTML validates, your Template code will also validate too.

===Can I customize the attribute names?===
If the attribute names are incompatible with your existing website, you can change them to your own custom name:
<code language="javascript">
<script src="distal.js"></script> 
<script> 
distal.qdef = "xdef"; 
distal.qattr = "xattr"; 
distal.qtext = "xtext"; 
//... etc.
</script>

<div xattr="rss.feeds.title"></div>
</code>
This also helps if you want shorten the attribute names to reduce file size.

===How can I hook into Distal to perform some action before a node is modified?===
Add a callback function to Distal like this:
<code language=javascript>
distal.beforeAttr = function(node, attName, newAttValue) { /*your function*/ }; 
distal.beforeText = function(node, newText) { /*your function*/ };</code>
This is also a good place to drop in your animation code or debugging code. Make sure your callback function doesn't throw exceptions or else Distal will stop.

===Does it work with jQuery?===
Yes, but note that Distal needs the actual node as the parameter. JQuery by default, does not return actual nodes, but returns arrays. You need to call it like `distal($("table")[0], data)` and not like `distal($("table"), data)`.

===Do you support progressive enhancement?===
Yes, because your HTML also doubles as the template! When your page first loads, it will have all the data and HTML in place for older browsers to view. If the browser supports Javascript, when you call Distal it will modify the current page to insert new data inside it. Since the HTML is also the template, you will not have duplicated template code elsewhere.
